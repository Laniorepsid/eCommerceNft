                               # Project Flowchart

## üìù Description
The objective of our project is to replace the Physical/Digital warranty or ownership card by a blockchain based decaying warranty via NFTs which will ensure Transparency, Authenticity, and more Security. The method facilitates conversion of physical product warranty cards into decaying NFTs using ERC721
This include:
- Allow brands and retailers to introduce an NFT which accompanies each of their products
- Enable customers to use the digital NFT to verify the authenticity and ownership of their product and transfer ownership upon resale, if valid and required,
 - Allow brand/retailer to integrate the digital NFT to its warranty program, allowing owners to track repairs and replacements to the original item.

## ‚ú® Product registration
When a product is manufactured, it is registered on the e-Commerce warranty system.
The registration process include
- creating a digital identity for the product
- storing information such as the product‚Äôs make, model, serial number, and other relevant details.
We should develop a web-based user interface for manufacturers to register their products to the system by using product registration form, product details input, and product image upload.

## ‚ú® NFT Minting

Once registered, the NFT representing the product certificate is generated and attached to the product‚Äôs digital identification. 
The NFT contains information such as the name of the registration date, the warranty expiration date, and the unique serial number used to verify the authenticity of the product. 
NFTs are minted and stored and transferred in a tamper-proof and decentralized manner on the Ethereum blockchain network.

## ‚ú® Product sale and Warranty Verification

Once registered, the NFT representing the product certificate is generated and attached to the product‚Äôs digital identification. 
The NFT contains information such as the name of the registration date, the warranty expiration date, and the unique serial number used to verify the authenticity of the product. 
NFTs are minted and stored and transferred in a tamper-proof and decentralized manner on the Ethereum blockchain network.

## ‚ú® Warranty claims

The consumer‚Äôs warranty claim is transferred to the manufacturer through the e-Commerce warranty system. The manufacturer may use product NFT to validate the product and process warranty claims accordingly.
A web-based user interface has been developed for manufacturers to handle warranty claims and manage their products in the system. 
The proposed system is implemented on a blockchain network, which provides tamper-proof storage of the product‚Äôs digital identity and NFTs as shown in figure 2. 
This ensures that the product‚Äôs authenticity and ownership can be verified and tracked throughout its lifetime. In order to evaluate the proposed system, a prototype of the system is implemented and tested with a sample set of products. 
The metrics used for evaluation are authentication accuracy, the percentage of products that are correctly identified as authentic or counterfeit.

The Seller can mint the Warranty NFT and generate warranty for the customers. This happens by calling a function from the deployed contract which takes care of minting.

The customer can claim the warranty by clicking the ‚ÄòClaim‚Äô button in the expanded view of the NFT. After a successful claim, the claim timeline will be updated with the new claim data. 
This also happens by calling a dedicated function which handles the claim process and returns required data. When a customer buys a product and is issued a Warranty NFT, he/she is awarded some points (Purchase Points) 
which is set by the seller at the time of deployment. If at the time of issuing warranty, the customer has points more than or equal to the Threshold Points, then he/she can use points and get an extra 100 days (Extra Warranty) of warranty period. 
After doing so, some points (Redeem Points) are deducted from the customer‚Äôs total points. Note that in current implementation Purchase Points, Threshold Points, Extra Warranty and Redeem Points are set by the seller at the time of contract deployment.
